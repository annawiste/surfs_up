# Temperature Trends in Oahu for June and December


## Overview
The current project is designed to provide insight into recent trends in temperature on the island of Oahu. June and December are chosen to provide a snapshot of the climate at two very different times of year. We are trying to determine if the climate is likely to support a successful ice cream shop business throughout the year. 
The available database contains temperature observations in Oahu from June 2010-2017 and December 2010-2016.

## Results

- The mean temperature in June has been 74.9° F (± 3.3°).
- The mean temperature in December is 71.0° F (± 3.7°).
- The minimum temperature in December was 56° while in June it was 64°.
